## Project Background
NovaMed Solutions is a leading pharmaceutical distributor established in 2022. The company sells prescription medicines through its online store as well as through end-of-the-line chemists and pharmacies. NovaMed serves a diverse healthcare sector, ensuring the availability of essential medications. However, inefficiencies in demand forecasting, stock management, and customer engagement strategies have impacted operational effectiveness.

The company has large data silos containing sales records, customer information, and drug data. Currently, NovaMed is facing challenges in consolidating and optimising sales performance, managing inventory efficiently, and identifying key market opportunities from its multiple data sources.

Since its inception in 2022, the company has gathered comprehensive sales data, including revenue, profit margins, drug performance, and customer demographics. To enhance business strategies and streamline operations through data-driven decision-making, an in-depth analysis was conducted to identify trends and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Data Structure & Initial Checks  

NovaMed-Solutions main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: `Sales Fact Table`, `Customer Dim`, `Drug Lookup Dim`, and `Calendar Dim`, with the fact table housing a total row count of **1,826 records**.  

A description of each table is as follows:  

- **Sales Fact Table** - Cosntitutes of the table that consistantly gets updated. The table contains a primary key `SaleID` and foreign keys for other dim tables such as `DrugID`, `CustomerID`, and `Sale Date`. Also includes other columns data `UnitsSold` and `Buyer Type`. `Revenue`, `Profit` and `Cost of Goods` Calculated columns have also been added to the table for analysiss purposes.
- **Customer Dim** - Contains the customer personal data `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Age`, and `Gender`. `Age group` calculated column has been added to best categorize cusromer dimention for analysis.
- Drug Lookup Dim** - Drug details like `RegulatoryComplianceID`,`DrugName`,`UnitSalesPrice`,`CostOfProduction`,`Treats`. The numerical columns of this table contribute to the creation of the calculated columns in thhe FactTable using **RELATED** keyword.
- **Calendar Dim** - Contains a calender custom made to comform with the periods novamed has been in business, includes `Year`, `Month Name`, `Date Month Number` which is essential for the line chart month over month analysis.
  
## Entity Relationship Diagram  
- The model is a `star model` with the fact table at the centre, with connections to the dim tables using their primary keys to create a relationship.
- All the dim tables are a `1-to-many` relationship with the fact table.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation  

Before commencing the analysis, the following initial steps were conducted:  
- üì• **Gathering datasets** from different online locations.  
- üîÑ **Transforming the data** from `CSV` format into `Power Query` for further transformation.  

The data cleaning and transformation process included:  
- üóëÔ∏è **Removing duplicate IDs** and replacing errors with placeholder values or removing them to avoid outliers.  
- üîß **Converting column types** into the correct data type, such as changing the `MM-DD-YYYY` format that caused errors into short date conversion by using `Locale`.  
- üë• **Grouping customer ages** from raw numeric values into age segments such as `Senior`, `Gen X`, `Millennials`, and `Gen Z`.  
- üîó **Creating relationships** by establishing 1-to-many links between the dimension tables and the fact table.  
- üìÖ **Improving time intelligence** by using both month name and month number to ensure correct month categorisation on the X-axis for line charts.

## Methodology
**NovaMed Solutions: Sales Performance Analysis & Reporting**

The SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) has been utilized to evaluate the sales performance of NovaMed Solutions.
By integrating SWOT analysis with sales metrics and Power BI dashboards, we identify trends, highlight areas for improvement, and anticipate potential challenges that may impact operations.

This structured approach provides strategic insights beyond mere data, supporting informed decision-making to enhance business strategies and optimize overall performance.

**SWOT Breakdown**
**Strengths**
Products such as **Doxycycline** and **Lisinopril**, which have the highest profit margins and the largest sales volumes, serve as core revenue drivers and significantly contribute to the company's profitability.

**Weaknesses**
Underperforming products like **Amoxicillin** and **Fluticasone**, which generate low revenue or possess low profit margins, hinder efficiency and indicate areas that require reevaluation.

**Opportunities**
Untapped markets and customer segments offer potential for revenue growth at relatively low costs. For instance, expanding into **Australia** and implementing targeted campaigns for **Generation X frequent buyers** could be a beneficial move.

**Threats**
External risks include rising costs of raw materials (COGS), declining selling prices, and a substantial drop in annual revenue, which fell from **$5.19 million in December 2023** to a decrease of **59.18% in January 2024**. These factors may place pressure on profit margins and overall competitiveness.

</p>

- The majority of customers, in terms of quantity sold, were direct end users.
- However, the customers who purchased the drugs for resale generated significantly higher revenue, totalling $62.86 million, compared to just $8.45 million from end users. 
- This indicates that while third-party sellers bought fewer drugs, their prices were considerably higher than those sold to end users.

### Location
<p align="center">

## Strategic Recommendations for NovaMed Solutions  

Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend the [stakeholder team] to consider the following:

### 1. Revenue & Profit Optimization  
- Introduce seasonal promotions or discount campaigns to stabilise sales throughout the year.
- Bundle underperforming drugs like Amoxicillin  with top performers like Doxycycline
- Monitor turnover of low-demand drugs to minimise overstocking and reduce holding costs.
 
### 2. Top Drug Strategy  
- Secure long-term supplier agreements to ensure steady availability for top-selling drugs.
- Invest in campaigns to enhance the market share of top-selling drugs.
- Explore new drug categories aligned with top performer trends.

### 3. Customer Relationship Management  
- Reward top customers like Bob Williams with exclusive loyalty discounts.
- Target underperforming customers (Carol Smith) with personalised offers.
- Tailor campaigns by customer type and age group (e.g., incentives for¬†Gen X frequent buyers).

### 4. Geographical Expansion  
- Strengthen presence by focusing on preferred senior male customers in Canada.
- Expand campaigns targeting frequent senior female buyers in Australia.
- Explore opportunities in regions with smaller but growing revenue streams in Europe.

### 5. Operational Efficiency  
- Leverage Power BI predictive models to align stock with seasonal demand.
- Deploy real-time Power BI Service dashboards to track revenue, margins, and stock levels.
- Set automated notifications to track low inventory of high-demand products.

### 6. Future Growth Opportunities  
- Utilize predictive analytics to forecast sales performance by drug and region.  
- Implement customer engagement tools, such as developing a mobile app or creating email campaigns informed by demographic insights.
- Enhance e-commerce personalization by recommending products based on customers' purchase history, following best practices from leading retail platforms.
  
## Assumptions and Caveats

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

### Assumptions
This analysis accepted an assumption that: 
- The extremely high sales in 2023 are likely due to a partnership with another supplier, boosting revenue.
- The conflicting relationship between CustomerID and Buyer Type (User or Seller) in the Fact table indicates how customers acquired the medicine. This is to maintain normalisation and prevent any ambiguity regarding transitive dependency, as it is essential to store Buyer Type as an attribute in the Customer table, as it is an inherent characteristic of the customer.
- Duplicate SalesID entries had unique values in other columns, indicating a possible data entry error. An indexed SalesID column was created as a primary key for the Fact table.

### Caveats
-  The Buyer Type in the Fact table may not fully represent customer behaviour due to normalisation issues. Therefore, insights derived from this field should be interpreted with caution.
-  The dataset does not account for market dynamics, supply chain disruptions, competitor actions, or regulatory changes, all of which could impact actual sales and profitability trends.
