## Project Background
NovaMed Solutions is a leading pharmaceutical distributor established in 2022. The company sells prescription medicines through its online store as well as through end-of-the-line chemists and pharmacies. NovaMed serves a diverse healthcare sector, ensuring the availability of essential medications. However, inefficiencies in demand forecasting, stock management, and customer engagement strategies have impacted operational effectiveness.

The company has large data silos containing sales records, customer information, and drug data. Currently, NovaMed is facing challenges in consolidating and optimising sales performance, managing inventory efficiently, and identifying key market opportunities from its multiple data sources.

Since its inception in 2022, the company has gathered comprehensive sales data, including revenue, profit margins, drug performance, and customer demographics. To enhance business strategies and streamline operations through data-driven decision-making, an in-depth analysis was conducted to identify trends and key performance indicators (KPIs).

# Data Structure & Initial Checks  

NovaMed-Solutions main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: `Sales Fact Table`, `Customer Dim`, `Drug Lookup Dim`, and `Calendar Dim`, with the fact table housing a total row count of **1,826 records**.  

A description of each table is as follows:  

- **Sales Fact Table** - Cosntitutes of the table that consistantly gets updated. The table contains a primary key `SaleID` and foreign keys for other dim tables such as `DrugID`, `CustomerID`, and `Sale Date`. Also includes other columns data `UnitsSold` and `Buyer Type`. `Revenue`, `Profit` and `Cost of Goods` Calculated columns have also been added to the table for analysiss purposes.
- **Customer Dim** - Contains the customer personal data `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Age`, and `Gender`. `Age group` calculated column has been added to best categorize cusromer dimention for analysis.
- Drug Lookup Dim** - Drug details like `RegulatoryComplianceID`,`DrugName`,`UnitSalesPrice`,`CostOfProduction`,`Treats`. The numerical columns of this table contribute to the creation of the calculated columns in thhe FactTable using **RELATED** keyword.
- **Calendar Dim** - Contains a calender custom made to comform with the periods novamed has been in business, includes `Year`, `Month Name`, `Date Month Number` which is essential for the line chart month over month analysis.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation  

Before commencing the analysis, the following initial steps were conducted:  
- üì• **Gathering datasets** from different online locations.  
- üîÑ **Transforming the data** from `CSV` format into `Power Query` for further transformation.  

The data cleaning and transformation process included:  
- üóëÔ∏è **Removing duplicate IDs** and replacing errors with placeholder values or removing them to avoid outliers.  
- üîß **Converting column types** into the correct data type, such as changing the `MM-DD-YYYY` format that caused errors into short date conversion by using `Locale`.  
- üë• **Grouping customer ages** from raw numeric values into age segments such as `Senior`, `Gen X`, `Millennials`, and `Gen Z`.  
- üîó **Creating relationships** by establishing 1-to-many links between the dimension tables and the fact table.  
- üìÖ **Improving time intelligence** by using both month name and month number to ensure correct month categorisation on the X-axis for line charts.

### Methodology
**NovaMed Solutions: Sales Performance Analysis & Reporting**

The SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) has been utilized to evaluate the sales performance of NovaMed Solutions. By integrating SWOT analysis with sales metrics and Power BI dashboards, we identify trends, highlight areas for improvement, and anticipate potential challenges that may impact operations. 

This structured approach provides strategic insights beyond mere data, supporting informed decision-making to enhance business strategies and optimize overall performance.

**SWOT Breakdown**
- **Strengths**: Products such as Doxycycline and Lisnopril, which have the highest profit margins or largest sales volumes, serve as core revenue drivers and contribute significantly to the company's profitability.
  
- **Weaknesses**: Underperforming products, such as Amoxicillin and Fluticasone, with low sales or minimal profit margins, reduce efficiency and highlight areas that need reassessment.
  
- **Opportunities**: Untapped markets and customer segments present potential for revenue growth at relatively low costs. For example, expansion into Australia and targeted campaigns for Generation X frequent buyers could be beneficial.
  
- **Threats**: External risks include rising costs of raw materials (COGS), declining selling prices, and a significant decrease in annual revenue, which plummeted from $39.26 million in 2023 to $914,000 in 2025. These factors may exert pressure on profit margins and overall competitiveness.

# Assumptions and Caveats

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

- Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
- Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
- Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
