# NovaMed-Solutions
## Project Background
NovaMed Solutions is a leading pharmaceutical distributor established in 2022. The company sells prescription medicines through its online store as well as through end-of-the-line chemists and pharmacies. NovaMed serves a diverse healthcare sector, ensuring the availability of essential medications. However, inefficiencies in demand forecasting, stock management, and customer engagement strategies have impacted operational effectiveness.

The company has large data silos containing sales records, customer information, and drug data. Currently, NovaMed is facing challenges in consolidating and optimising sales performance, managing inventory efficiently, and identifying key market opportunities from its multiple data sources.

Since its inception in 2022, the company has gathered comprehensive sales data, including revenue, profit margins, drug performance, and customer demographics. To enhance business strategies and streamline operations through data-driven decision-making, an in-depth analysis was conducted to identify trends and key performance indicators (KPIs).


Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Top/Bottom Analysis:** This involves tracking overall sales metrics, including revenue, profit, and cost of goods sold (COGS).
- **Month-over-Month Comparison:** An analysis comparing the performance of drugs in terms of revenue and profit with the previous month.
- **Customer Analysis:** An assessment of how customer segments, such as age group, purchasing category, and gender, influence revenue, profit, and sales.
- **Geographical Analysis:** An examination of the key revenue sources based on customers' geographical locations, including countries.

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

- Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
- Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
- Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
