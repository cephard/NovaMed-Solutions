## Project Background
NovaMed Solutions is a leading pharmaceutical distributor established in 2022. The company sells prescription medicines through its online store as well as through end-of-the-line chemists and pharmacies. NovaMed serves a diverse healthcare sector, ensuring the availability of essential medications. However, inefficiencies in demand forecasting, stock management, and customer engagement strategies have impacted operational effectiveness.

The company has large data silos containing sales records, customer information, and drug data. Currently, NovaMed is facing challenges in consolidating and optimising sales performance, managing inventory efficiently, and identifying key market opportunities from its multiple data sources.

Since its inception in 2022, the company has gathered comprehensive sales data, including revenue, profit margins, drug performance, and customer demographics. To enhance business strategies and streamline operations through data-driven decision-making, an in-depth analysis was conducted to identify trends and key performance indicators (KPIs).

# Data Structure & Initial Checks  

NovaMed-Solutions main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: `Sales Fact Table`, `Customer Dim`, `Drug Lookup Dim`, and `Calendar Dim`, with the fact table housing a total row count of **1,826 records**.  

A description of each table is as follows:  

- **Sales Fact Table** - Cosntitutes of the table that consistantly gets updated. The table contains a primary key `SaleID` and foreign keys for other dim tables such as `DrugID`, `CustomerID`, and `Sale Date`. Also includes other columns data `UnitsSold` and `Buyer Type`. `Revenue`, `Profit` and `Cost of Goods` Calculated columns have also been added to the table for analysiss purposes.
- **Customer Dim** - Contains the customer personal data `First Name`, `Last Name`, `Age`, and `Gender`. `Age group` calculated column has been added to best categorize cusromer dimention for analysis.
- Drug Lookup Dim** - Drug details like `RegulatoryComplianceID`,`DrugName`,`UnitSalesPrice`,`CostOfProduction`,`Treats`. The numerical columns of this table contribute to the creation of the calculated columns in thhe FactTable using **RELATED** keyword.
- **Calendar Dim** - Contains a calender custom made to comform with the periods novamed has been in business, includes `Year`, `Month Name`, `Date Month Number` which is essential for the line chart month over month analysis.
  
## Entity Relationship Diagram  
- The model is a `star model` with the fact table at the centre, with connections to the dim tables using their primary keys to create a relationship.
- All the dim tables are a `1-to-many` relationship with the fact table.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation  

Before commencing the analysis, the following initial steps were conducted:  
- üì• **Gathering datasets** from different online locations.  
- üîÑ **Transforming the data** from `CSV` format into `Power Query` for further transformation.  

The data cleaning and transformation process included:  
- üóëÔ∏è **Removing duplicate IDs** and replacing errors with placeholder values or removing them to avoid outliers.  
- üîß **Converting column types** into the correct data type, such as changing the `MM-DD-YYYY` format that caused errors into short date conversion by using `Locale`.  
- üë• **Grouping customer ages** from raw numeric values into age segments such as `Senior`, `Gen X`, `Millennials`, and `Gen Z`.  
- üîó **Creating relationships** by establishing 1-to-many links between the dimension tables and the fact table.  
- üìÖ **Improving time intelligence** by using both month name and month number to ensure correct month categorisation on the X-axis for line charts.

### Methodology
**NovaMed Solutions: Sales Performance Analysis & Reporting**

The SWOT framework (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) has been utilized to evaluate the sales performance of NovaMed Solutions.
By integrating SWOT analysis with sales metrics and Power BI dashboards, we identify trends, highlight areas for improvement, and anticipate potential challenges that may impact operations.

This structured approach provides strategic insights beyond mere data, supporting informed decision-making to enhance business strategies and optimize overall performance.

**SWOT Breakdown**
**Strengths**
Products such as **Doxycycline** and **Lisinopril**, which have the highest profit margins and the largest sales volumes, serve as core revenue drivers and significantly contribute to the company's profitability.

**Weaknesses**
Underperforming products like **Amoxicillin** and **Fluticasone**, which generate low revenue or possess low profit margins, hinder efficiency and indicate areas that require reevaluation.

**Opportunities**
Untapped markets and customer segments offer potential for revenue growth at relatively low costs. For instance, expanding into **Australia** and implementing targeted campaigns for **Generation X frequent buyers** could be a beneficial move.

**Threats**
External risks include rising costs of raw materials (COGS), declining selling prices, and a substantial drop in annual revenue, which fell from **$5.19 million in December 2023** to a decrease of **59.18% in January 2024**. These factors may place pressure on profit margins and overall competitiveness.

# Assumptions and Caveats

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

##Assumptions
- It is assumed that data entry and collection were conducted correctly prior to the analysis.
- The exceptionally high sales in 2023 are likely due to a strategic partnership or collaboration with another supplier, boosting overall revenue.
- The CustomerID corresponding to the Buyer Type in the Fact table had conflicting relationships. It is assumed that the Buyer Type (User or Seller) represents how the customer acquired the medicine‚Äîeither directly from NovaMed as a user or via a third-party retailer.
- This assumption is necessary because the Fact table violates the 3rd normal form due to a transitive dependency.
- If the data were fully normalized, Buyer Type would belong to the Customer table.
- Therefore, basing results on Buyer Type may slightly misrepresent customer behavior. It is treated as a pseudo key to indicate the acquisition method rather than a definitive attribute of the customer.

##Caveats
- Data Quality Limitations ‚Äì Some records may contain errors, duplicates, or missing values, which could slightly affect the accuracy of revenue, profit, or customer analyses.
- Buyer Type Interpretation ‚Äì Since Buyer Type in the Fact table may not fully reflect customer behavior due to normalization issues, insights based on this field should be interpreted with caution.
- External Factors Not Considered ‚Äì Market dynamics, supply chain disruptions, competitor actions, or regulatory changes were not captured in the dataset but could impact actual sales and profitability trends.
